High dropout rates and poor academic performance among university students remain critical challenges for higher education institutions. Accurate prediction of student outcomes is essential for strategic resource allocation, improving institutional reputation, and enhancing educational interventions.

This study compares the efficacy of Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) in predicting first-year academic performance, measured by three categories: Clear Pass (CP), Proceed and Repeat (PR), and Part-Time (PT).

Using institutional data from Copperbelt University (2015–2020), including Grade 12 subject scores and enrollment records across five schools School of Mathematics & Natural Sciences (SMNS), School of Mines & Mineral Sciences (SMMS), School of Business (SB), School of Built Environment (SBE), and School of Engineering (SE), we evaluated both models’ classification accuracy, precision, and sensitivity via confusion matrices.

The results from this analysis will demonstrate how predictive modeling can effectively identify at-risk students early, enabling targeted academic support.
